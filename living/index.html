<P>Hello Und Welcome inside my living room...parp parp. My name is Billy which in an ancient
   language means the boy that is Monkey. I am 26 and was born in Dublin, Ireland. I am back
   in the US, Florida, where I have spent five of the last six years( Florida, Chicago ), Its
   Awesome. It's one of my great dreams to have a sandwich named after me.
<P>I am building this page so I can stay in touch and show some of the things that I am up too.
   I have loaded a few plucky little midi files in the music room. If you too enjoy midi renditions
   then get on in there. My favorite in the playlist is RATM.
<H3>TE...UPDATE...UPDATE...UPDATE...UPDATE...</H3>
  <P> MARCH - I'm glad to say a big hello to two new persons on the planet today, Hello to Aidan and Theresa.
    These guys are my newly minted cousins so a special parp parp to both you and your parents.
<P>7 March 2000 : I began the year by spending weekends in Dublin and commuting to Letterkenny, Co. Donegal
   during the week. I was in Mexico between 23/29 February and managed to fit in a beautiful day
   at Las Estacas, a natural water park. Last week, 1/5 March, I was in Dublin which was great,
   I met up with friends and stuck my head around the door at the office. Now that I'm back in
   Florida, I plan to get some diving done and there are some fiendish plans afoot to go
   snowboarding up in North Carolina. My brother Stephen is coming down from Chicago that weekend, will
   he share the same enthusiasm for snow ??? hmmmmmmm. I really want to go though, over the last few years
   I have heard everbodys' stories about Skiing and Boarding and I really want to try it out.
   <BR>
   Plus, I recently bought a notebook ( Toshiba 1625CDT...a little workhorse! ) so Update City...Hello.
<BR>
<P>24 March 2000 : Well the mountain was closed so I'll just have to go on hearing about snowboarding.
  Instead of going to North Carolina, we went down to Key West, kicked back and drank Margaritas following it up with
  a trip to Cape Canaveral...Houston We have a couple of Murphys !!. It was my second time and I got to meet a real
  life astronaut, Jon McBride, who was the commander of the first Shuttle Launch. This guy has been in space people!! Also went
  to the IMAX which was made by the crew of a mission "The Dream is Alive" ( absolutely incredible ). There is a launch on
  April 17 which I am going to try and get to, that would be deadly!! We also took in a little South Beach action. Anyhows, Steve
  hope you enjoyed your Spring Break!! ( Spring F***ing Break !! - Ho Ho Ho )
<BR>
<P>28 March 2000 : Went diving for the first time in ages last weekend. Saw a Giant Sea turtle.
   She was just incredible, so majestic, it really was like the coral came alive and just floated up. Got to know Jose a little bit
   better too !!!
<BR>
<P>3 April 2000 : The Matrix was on HBO over the weekend, it only came out a year ago!. The rest
   of the weekend I spent reading and swimming. Got a little bit sunburned on Sunday.
<BR>
<P>10 April : Went out to Fort Lauderdale over the weekend and had some fish & chips at the
   Lord Nelson, mmmmmmmmmmmmmm...tasty.
<BR>

<P>Summer Time - Underneath the Banyan Tree ( Post Dated - 26 Sep ) : I spent the summer with a friend <!-- ( little one, are you reading this, I have missed you, call me ) --> and also
took a trip to Dublin and London. At work I was finishing up before moving out to California to start with a new company.
<BR>
<P>Sunday August 13th : Hi Fawcett's, Thanks for showing me a little of the life in Pennington. There are some sweet sounds
emanating from the basement, maybe we could digitize it and start an internet record label  :?)
<P>Tuesday August 22nd 2:34am: Later on today I am flying out to California to begin a new chapter of my life. I am awake now
listening to the sounds of the appartment. I hope that this new adventure will be a fullfilling addition to the book of my life
and that it will add to the chapters that have gone before. I have had a truley great time in Miami. Now im going to sleep, I have an early start in the morning...
<P>11:37 pm Pacific time : ...Made it ! Im at the hotel, watching some tv, getting sleepy. I drove around the city earlier on a preliminary
 bearings mission which I continue tomorrow

<BR>
<P>Thursday August 24th: First day at school today...went well. Yesterday morning as I pulled onto
101 north, headed for downtown San Francisco, Magical Mystery Tour came on the radio, awesome music momment. Lots of
Beach Boy play on the radio too which Im not used and am enjoying.
<BR>
<P>September Random : The coffee shop I sometimes go to plays some really great music...Belle & Sebastian today, How awesome is that. This city
is educated musically.
<BR>
<P>September 26th : Post St Charles, Illinois... Big Hi to all in my group that are reading this. Im back in San Francisco doing some CBT Type stuff
and chasing other details related to starting up, laptop enablement registration etc etc, It was a great time. After staying Cold free for the entire two weeks, I succumbed to one
over the weekend ( I stayed in Chicago and I think it crept in on Saturday night ), very interesting news I know, such is the life I lead. Coming into SFO again after only moving here a month ago I didnt expect it to be different but it was.
 This time I was not facing a blank page but was picking up a little into the first chapter, Hey San Francisco. As Bueller the Great once said, Life moves pretty fast, if you
dont stand back and look around every so often, you might miss something. I spent some time looking at that picture in the Art Institute of Chicago.

<P>Big Hi also to Stephen, Anne, Chip, Aidan, Gary, Dean, Leslie, Joe, Dave K & Dave McC. It was good seeing you all, I hadn't seen any of you in a long time and now I cant
really remember seeing anybody on account of the Leffe ( 10% ) beer saturday night at the Hop Leaf, Jeeez, that stuff would drop an elephant.( only kidding btw )</B>

for dinner.</P>

<P>May 2004 - in a rough job market ive got a job working at the Art Insitute. Ive always figured that if everything hit the fan I could
always get a job as a bartender, so i guess everything has hit the fan, at least im in chicago now. I have  great affinity for the Art Insitute, I remember seeing the Kandisnky whose print hung
in our kitchen for real. Its also cool being in a well organized environment with flow and stuff.</P>

<P>January 2005 - got a second job at the airport, wow, my career is in great shape. Its not as enjoyable as the Art Institute but it does earn more which is kind of ridiculously considering that its not very busy.</P>

Spring is in the air !!</P>

I was diving and it felt great !</P>

<P>January 2006 - Started a web development course, the economy seems to be picking up again and
hopefully over the summer when I finish will be able to find work in programming again. The guys who operate the course are scheisters of the highest order so its
not too different than the course i took in Dublin. The course content is allright though and the teachers ok.</P>

<P>March 2006 - Since i missed going to Dublin this Christmas I took a trip before the air prices
went up. went out every night, was a great visit, went to Bruxelles and met up with marcus at the
stags head, visited some new places, played golf with dad and got to listen to some huuddy maguddy stories, the very best.</P>

<P>June 2006 - World Cup finals : As Ireland did not qualify, I was supporting England, USA, and Australia. Overall, a disappointing tournament all round, a lot of conservative play
with little frontal attacking, mostly set piece stuff. Though Ireland PSP did win on my psp fantasy world cup.</P>

<P>December 2006 - Christmas in Dublin, what a great time it was, went to a Lir concert and Andy Mac was there, Quinner

<P>January 2007 - Car got towed two days after getting back from christmas. It was parked in a snow zone during 50 degree
weather.</P>

<P>February 2007 - England play in croker, played there myself a number of times in the school leagues. A grand day it was too.</P>

<P>February 2007 - Bought a new laptop, its a Vaio, how awesome is that, it goes so well with my PSP. Its a 220N, with a $200 rebate, ba-ding!!
Its a budget model that they are releasing to compete with the macs, i dont think it really compares with a mac, even a mac with an intel inside,
though its still mighty nice to upgrade from my current hardware.</P>

<p> Jose, I like the movie questionaire, I finally filled it out, I laugh at your selection of movies.</p>

<p>April 2007 - Cadbury creme eggs are out again, in fact im off to get one now.</p>

<p>April 2007 - The Masters! Harrington went for it on the 15th, thats the mark of a potential masters champion.
Whatever the reason that the ball didnt get up on the green, air temperature, wind, strike, whatever, he still went for it.
-Vicky brought me to a Culinary Heritage Event on South Michigan. They are trying to archive and preserve old menus so they held an event where they cooked selections from varied menus. It was really awesome, Rick Bayless gave a lecture on what he thinks will be on menus of the future and how it will be added to by Mexican Menus.
- Went to Indiana Dunes for the first time, reminded me a lot of Curracloe in Wexford. On the way back we stopped off at Smoque and low and behold, who was there but Rick Bayless with none other than the Chow Hound from one of the papers. He looked over and had a 'where have i seen those people before look' for an instant. Awesome, we are hanging in the same place as Channel 11 celebrities.
-Played golf in Glencoe's public course, its nice to be outside after the winter in chicago, pity my golf didnt live up to it. On sunday, watched a lot of movies over at vicky's, ordered out and then went for a walk in the evening. Later there was a lightening storm which was awesome and perfectly timed.</P>

<p>May 2007 - C'mon ye reds</p>

<p>May 2007 - There are some images from a day in the life in the dark room, May 03 and May 06. I bought a digital camera, which, for a person who takes as few photoes as I do, is a luxury. I am planning my first foray into
film making with the enthusiasm which the purchase has generated. Amidst these great dreams, I do maintain a sneaking self awareness that it will be gathering dust after the weekend.</p>

<p>My Declaration of Football Support.Hurling - Kilkenny, Football - Dublin, Rugby - Irish National Team & Leinster, English Football - Liverpool, American Football - Chicago</p>

<p>:  I was going to call in sick and go to Gingers but decided to attend work and slip out for a late lunch at fado instead, at least i'll get a chance to watch the game there.</p>

<p> May 23 2007 : LIVERPOOL, LIVERPOOL, LIVERPOOL</p>
<p> May 23 2007<br>
    The better team lost as can be the case, i am completely confused as to what the offside rule is nowadays, not on the first goal but the second. I am going to call in sick tomorrow. On the bright side, RAFA is going to get us a
league title and this style of play is a part of taking the first step, playing a more solid game with a better overall tactical approach, all we need as we have all season is for the goals to start going in. Liverpool did not look clinical at the front. Maybe we do need a prolific scorer upon whom reliance is diversified by a reliable and productive ensemble cast.( Owen + Fowler + a few other heads style )<br><br>LIVERPOOL, LIVERPOOL, LIVERPOOL</p>

<P>June 2007 : Went to Colorado with Vicky to meet her family, had a really great time and enjoyed meeting everybody. There should be some photos of some of the trip in the dark room.</P>
<P>July 2007 : The weather is getting hot in Chicago, Its just finished being cold. Watched the fireworks from adler planetarium on the 3rd and saw some of the park fireworks on the 4th.</P>
<P> Life as an ineffectual man : Insights into my occupation as a technology developer. im drawn to technology, i find it exciting to be able to make machines do things, maybe its not so much making them do things as much as it is being a person who has mastered the skills to make them do them.  There is also the instant hit of satisfaction of solving a problem that is confounding people but this lessens over time.However, machines are cold, there is no true decision making, just information generation and organization. Great keepers of facts and figures that other people are interested in, they do not generate these facts and figures but manipulate and report on them.
They are not the spur to civilization but only the tool of it. They do not drive events, they may enable, but as a developer I am only enabling other peoples events, never my own. They are true people pleasers, I hate the term, its the kind of thing other people look upon unfavorably.( thats a joke )<br>postdated : oh, give it a break</P>

<p>August 2007 : Killkenny win the All Ireland after a spirited performance from Limrick. I've been up to a ton of stuff but I cant think of what that is right now. Went to the Dentist, everything was ok, no damage to report.</p>
<p> September 28 2007<br>
Two Beastie Boys concerts in a row. First time ive done two consecutive nights of a show since Metallica at the top hat in 1988. The first show was a Gala Event at the Riviera ( wore a tuxedo with black and white adidas ) and the second a regular show at Northerly Island in Chicago, the site of Megs Field, and named Mike D harbor for the night. Both nights were really great and the first night was the best show at the Riviera since Radiohead.
The Beastie Boys career is as inspiring as I think you can find for people in my age group and they put on some really great shows. And its true, Nobody Can Do It - Like Mix Master Can Do It. Shook hands with the robot as well. Also saw Stevie Wonder earlier in the month.<br>
I am suffering from a little Liverpool anxiety as after a great start, they look like they are acquiescing to giving away points again.<br>
Im moving apartment this weekend though staying in the same neighborhood. Its golf season again, Hurrah, have played some good rounds so far though mostly incomplete as the play is so slow, tut tut.<br>
I've been listening to a radio show on Phantom radio ( www.phantom.ie ) called Metal Notes, Its a great show and as good a metal show since Tommy Thighes thursday night show on Capitol (sic - ooops, Capital ), its also great to keep in touch with the traffic reports in Dublin, gotten some requests played also. This is the first year that i've been involved in a fantasy football season(American) and its compelling, it really creates an interest in the weekly goings on in the NFL and is enhancing my knowledge of the game.
Have been watching the reality show Top Chef with Vicky, we are both pulling for Dale.</p>

<p> October 5th : Ramblings....America = Reformation+Enlightenment+Capitalism( Eighteenth Century Industrial Revolution ).
Capitalism is the allocation of resources based upon return. Does unbridled captitalism tend inevitablty toward monopoly power and the allocation of resources in a less efficient manner. Do centers of capital create overly protective barriers to entry. Does it begin to look more like a communistic system.</p>

<p>Was the American revolution in part a product of the protestant reformation of the sixteenth century and the age of enlightenment in the eighteenth Century. Are the beneficial ideas of these movements still praticed in america. It may be that
europe has run out of land but do land and people in mass alone make a country great. China has for millenia possessed both in greater numbers than either europe or america but have not produced societies of comparable prosperity. It takes an overriding epistemological backbone that propels a society toward a beneficial existance. ( The fountainhead ) .
This being the case, where would provide a greater return to the human spirit than living in America ?<br>

Plus, all these values came from systems that were based upon taxation and entitlement. Is america becoming old europe, heavier taxation, more rigid class strucutres, ensconsed wealth classes. Is america in a process wherby it possibly will rediscover why its foundation was important, How long will this take and what will it be like for the people who live in it during this time. You only have one life to live.Will America in 50 years look like Europe 300 years ago.
i dont know enough about all this stuff to get to a true understanding.Truth is a great human value.</p>

<p> Critical Mass : Is Critical Mass an example of tyranny / anarchy / democracy.
Critical mass seeks to impose supremacy over automobile traffic. Automobile traffic gained this supremacy over decades of human choice through its technological advantages.
How much does an automobiles technological advantage outweigh its environmental cost in todays balance sheet. Are the bicyclist luddites or evolutionarys ?
Does CM impose the will of a local majority although it is in the overall minority. --- It doesnt nice like a good democracy, more anarchy / tyranny.</p>

<p> October 10th : Gigs I've been to in the last year : Beastie Boys, Stevie Wonder, Beck, Arcade Fire, Damien Rice, Mojave 3, Keane, Badly Drawn Boy.</p>

<p> November 1st : Stop the Press...Cadubury creme eggs in Winter, Walgreens is selling creme eggs, only the wrapper is different, they have a christmas ornament decoration but there is no mistaking whats inside. I dont know how I feel about this. I just ate two. Hang on, I know exactly how I feel, its excellent.</p>

<p> December 2007 : My Parents are coming into town for Christmas, cashing in on the outrageous exchage rates. I wanted to take my Dad To a Chicago Bears game but we both
agreed that the weather is too cold. We are doing a kraut cringle christmas where you only get a present for one person, problem is, you only get one present in return. I am looking forward to showing them some
of my haunts in Chicago. Also Big hello to the ex vti guys, Mark, and his silent partner on the emails, Dave, it was nice to hear some news. Liverpool looked so mediocre against Man U. Droping six points on the way into Christmas, Liverpool League Title ? Any Takers.</p>

<p> January 10, 2008 : Hi There,
Today, I woke up around 7:40 and fell out of bed, phoned a bank about some stuff, and made it to the el station with my current 30 day cta card which was set to expire about a minute after i got there, Yessss !

I read the redeye on the train, a very funny paper, i hope nothing is written that is not tounge in cheek. I got into the office at 9 and settled in the morning routine. For lunch, I went to L'appetito and had the pancetta and mozarella toastino with added tomato, basil and mayo. This was a good Sandwich. I got back to the office around 1:15 and settled into the afternoon routine. The time is now 3:19. I have been awake and active for 8 hours and 40 something minutes. Today is Thursday. Outside its 43 degrees, and cloudy.</p>

<p><font color='blue'><strong>[ *** The next two postings arose when a computer program reported an error describing it with one word "error" hence the error reported itself as having an error. Not the first times its happened by any means but sometimes sitting in cubicles your mind can wander ***]</strong></font>
<p> January 16,2008 : Theres an error in the error and its growing more and more, its becoming more than just an error, becoming more than just a chore, its a siren that is ringing and its calling to be heard, can you hear it in the distance, it is straining to be heard, far off but getting closer, its becoming quite absurd ! MARY HARNEY ATE ALL THE MALTEESERS !!</p>
<p>January 17, 2008 : Theres an error in the error yes theres something very wrong, cant quite put my finger on it, but theres something going on, its very very important, but its source is still unknown, in the time ive taken to write this, i think the error's grown!</p>

<p> Phew Glad that got sorted out back in January, its all good now...or did it...and is it.... :?) Course it did and is, and if it does happen again then we'll just take another look.</p>
<p>March 9 2008 : First Creme Egg of 2008, Thank you Pat Chambers, Thank you !</p>
<p>April 9 2008 : Ste Gerrard Gerrard, wonderful stuff. Check out the new icon, its like we are flying through time and space.</p>
<p> Just discovered The Mighty Boosh, really good stuff ! Time and Space cannot stop us now !! Hope Liverpool win this Wednesday.</p>
<p> June : Vti, Sorry to miss you guys, was looking forward to meeting up with you. </p>

<p> July 8th : Taking Care of a cat for the summer, its a nice cat to be around. Yeah, me and the cat.</p>

<p>August : Went to Coldplay at the United Center. They taped the show for a DVD and made a video for Lost. So if you see that video, im in the audience, the one at the back,up top, over to the left, cant miss me.</p>
<p>September : The Kilkenny cats make it three in row and Tyrone put up a brilliant show against cynical old Kerry. Kerry are crap, hahahahaha. </p><a></a>
<p>November : Thanksgiving, my trousers dont fit anymore and all the buttons have popped off. Very nice dinner on Thursday and especially Saturday.</p>
<p>December : Went to a Chicago Bears Game ( v Jacksonville ). I like the stadium, its quite cool to walk through the old pillars in the outer shell and then get the seating and line of sight benefits of the new inner shell. Soldier Field, as my Dad informed me, is the site of The Long Count where Jack Dempsey duked it out with Gene Tunney. When you have that kind of history, its worth hanging onto a bit of it. The temperature
for the game was around 8 F which comes out about -12 C. The beer froze in the cups, pretty cool.</p>
<p>Christams Time. Seasons Best to You! Im in Chicago where I cooked a turkey and got a christmas tree, very traditional, though no roses, still had what was left of the sack of sweets Carole brought over at thanksgiving.
----Post Christmas : Left back films to Blockbuster ( Elf, Duck Soup, Ghostbusters, Fred Claus - better than expected), Back at work, can hardly move, January in Chicago, Brrrrrrr, hit a pot hole, bent rim, changed wheel within 10 minute standard.
</p>
<p>Monday February 16. Cadburys creme eggs have returned joining the lengthening days the temperature's slow climb upwards from the depths of January. Its been a very cold one, brrrrr. Its going to take a little while to thaw out.</p>
<p>Oracle Buys Sun. Elements of the past, Elements of the future...combining together to form something not quite as good as either. Oh Dear, I think Sun's executives have sold out the java development community for a few dollars more. IBM have a wider platform of development. The IBM deal would have benefitted a Java Developer. Larry Ellison and his band of merry bucaneers is bad news. He's not going to care about the technology, he just wants more suits and to execute more power deals, samurai style.</p>

<p>August 2 : My favorite John Hughes line: My father spent three years restoring this car. It is his love, it is his passion ...its his fault he didnt lock the garage.<br></p>
<p>Also, Here's some quotes I find hilarious that I read on BBC World news. <a href="#" onClick="javascript:openNewBrowser('http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_8197000/8197932.stm');return false;">the article</a>
<br><br>
&quot;Perhaps most importantly, I was very surprised to discover how little systematic, hypothesis-driven empirical research had been conducted on flamingoes.&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;The researchers also discounted some other more outlandish theories, such as one that suggests standing on one leg helps flamingoes circulate blood better by limiting the Effects of gravity on their circulatory systems.&quot;</p>
<br><br>
August : The Kennedys embodied and gave great voice to a set of values which I think all people share. That there exists a brotherhood between man, that poverty and degradation exist in a world but they cannot in themselves quench the human spirit, that a world of inclusive prosperity is possible, and is something worth fighting for, that we can both individually and together as a race build upon the circumstances in which we find ourselves when we come onto this earth, that we can live a rich and full life in the time we are given, and that we can make a difference, in our lives and the lives of those we love.<br><br>
While that one voice may have fallen silent today in HyannisPort,MA, the fires still burn and the torch is passed. We have our voices, and while along way the light may falter and seem to fade, there shall not come a time when that torch shall be extinguished. For the fires from which it burns, burn in all of us, from the day we are born to the day that we too pass. The burden is passed, and falls upon us now, I know that I shall carry it forward. And that dream lives on inside of me.
<br>

<p>September : Summer has been a bit of a blow out. I did restore an old motorbike and pass my test on it, that is a bit awesome. Ive been learning bluegrass guitar on the guitar and thats coming on too. The cat is in very good form, she needs to have some dental work done though she doesnt really know about that yet so its not affecting her.</p>

<p>September : Brian Cowen has washed his hair and wants you to vote yes on the Lisbon treaty. Hes not much of an influence peddler so i guess at the end of the day it really is up to the people. Love Ireland. I think the Germans will lead Europe to disaster eventually but for now we are better off being in, were better off staying as close as we can. Its all a bit out of our control with the aligning of global powers. Its better than being in the commonwealth the way thats set up today, where we would always be the poor man and historically its totally impossible, still were not Asian. I dont have much of an idea what something like that would entail. Its an interesting option though, at the end of the day they can all fuck off. On a complete aside, did you see the state of Gaddaffi, that is messed up. There is a huge divide and the onus is on them to breach it, if they dont, well, they dont.</p>

<p>October 05 : 2009 - Saw Living Color at the double door last night, easily one of the best shows ever, up there with Beasties Gala Event ( or any Lir Show ). Incredibly tight and fluid music, just fantastic. They played until midnight, there were three sets, one old, one new, and then one just Amazing, Holy Shit, what a show.<br><br>Heres a link ( <a href="#" onClick="javascript:openNewBrowser('http://www.yamahaclub.com/forums/topic/17685-resurrecting-a-78-xs-400-thats-been-sitting-for-five-years/');return false;">right here</a>  ) that details last summers project getting a disused motorbike from the seventies back on the road.  Its a total Steve McQueen Machine. Its been great and has stirred memories of my Barton Drive days where people like Joe and Lou, Patrick O Connell and Andrew Keane had motorbikes, RD's, DTs and a Honda CB450, and were into working on them. I traded Patrick O Connell guitar lessons for Driving lessons. All these years I've had a biker jacket, now I have a motorbike. If you are ever in Chicago and are into old bikes, try Ace Motorcycles on Jackson, genuine bike smiths. I was there to pick up a new front tire the other day and a guy pulled in on a 1946 Harley Davidson, complete with a rifle holder on the front forks. This shop is authentic.</p>

<p>November 23 : 2009 : Catharsis of the World Cup qualifiers - Oh dear, I guess I really wish that Ireland had not been involved in a game that played out the way it did. Oh well, we lost but on the course of play we certainly werent defeated. Ireland played a great game and Ive never been prouder, and O Trapps can take a huge deal of credit for it. O Trapps is the man, the team has never performed with better discipline and tactics and thats what we need, well, in addition to being able to stick the ball in the back of the net. Yeah, the only regret or frustration is that we didnt take our chances during both games, and thats completely up to us. We have to take our chances, we have to, how many chances do we get for christs sake, we have to take them. And thats entirely within our control, We have to finish weaker teams, what this side likely was, without even breaking a sweat. Its up to the French and Henry to take it whatever way they do, I do think most of France feels no joy in the win, theres satisfaction perhaps amongst some, perhaps just relief with others but there is no joy, if they feel really good about it well I cant say I find them attractive. The FAI could withdraw from FIFA, thats about the only thing they can do, might do themselves out of a job, might be a courageous act on behalf of fair play, but thats the only alternative response possible. This utter gombeenism of Cowen in the EU is disgraceful. Theres no disgrace for Ireland in any of this except for the behavior of Cowen and Ahearn, sure put them on the spot so that they dont do it again but come on, in the EU. Fair play is very important in football but so is a little stealing of something you may want more than anything else in the world. Dont really know if Henry did, or what his motivation was, was it for his own personal ego, at the end of the day, only Henry can say, but depending on what he did it for, though he did get caught, I can see ways where I envy the guy, and its not the flock of lamberghinis that are in his garage or being able to play professionally. Well, hang on, understand me, i think he is utter shit for what he did, particularly as hes a good player who should be able to do it right. Its deeply cycnical for the competent, the graceful, the beautiful, those with all the advantages, to cheat so outrageously. Maybe Henry is ok, im finding it hard to tie it down but one must raise ones eyebrows at the response of the french elite. "Nothing to see here - Move along please / Let me be where I am".<br><br>have to add though, overall, from what i know, i like the French. In spite of the heartbreak. I fear I may have let them down terribly and that pain is very real, though not to be capitalised on. </p>

<p>January 2010. God Speed You Doctor, And Death Shall Have No Dominion. Possibly the best Christmas ever. Then the new year, January malaise is pretty much passed though it wasnt without extra special servings of excruciating crapness, not the most of which is Liverpools exciting new talent for conceding goals in the last seconds of games. Its fascinating really. On the upside, the doctors regeneration, Is it really an upper though, i really liked David Tennant, thought he was great, though its always the way with a regeneration. This one was a bit special, its probably the biggest one since Baker for me, ( a lot of them i didnt really care for anyway ) which is high praise indeed for the new series. I read in some of the media in England about how children growing up were always a bit scared and freaked out by the seventies show, all i could think was me too, i thought i was weird back then for feeling ill at ease and all this time I neednt have. Well, there you go. Interesting. BBC America totally delivered the goods with about 48 hours straight of the doctor, the best I gave was a 10 hour sitting. It would be great to have all the episodes and have a marathon, old and new, or old one week, then new another. Anyway, shake off those January Blues,  <a href="#" onClick="javascript:openNewBrowser('http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98I85ceICRM');return false;">Excellent Guitar Sound</a> ,and, <a href="#" onClick="javascript:openNewBrowser('http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gipG6jTb1Zs');return false;">Excellent Everything</a>.</p>

<p>February 12, 2010 : Everyone knows the French are a useless bunch, its probably why they get along so well with the Irish. So long as we celebrate our game tomorrow, and win.</p>

<p>February 15, 2010 : OUCH ! A bruising defeat, made worse by the apparent breakdown in discipline and composure, allbeit against a very strong French side. It was perhaps a believable outcome and using the earlier South Africa games as a benchmark of the teams, it wasnt wholly unexpected that we were in for a tough fight, but the one sidedness for the larger part of the game was dissapointing. Still, its not the end of the game or the campaign and theres not much else to do but to try and get our heads around what happened and prepare for the next game. The record of the team like the team itself is outstanding ( not unrelatedly ). It must be heartbreaking on them, more so by the length of time gone without a loss which can make it appear greater than it probably is, just as it is on everyone, but this was a game the French really wanted to win and it seems when dealing with the French that heartbreak is always a very possible outcome. Hard as it is to admit a loss, its nonetheless easy to congratulate them on their win, it was a good day to be French, as win they did and win well, Congratulations to France. Ireland Forever.</p>

<p>February 19, 2010 : Tiger Hunt Continues. Look at the Bad Man. Unbelievable, Its a witch hunt. What a puritanical bunch people can be, focusing their general unhapiness on this one guy, should not be tolerated. Tiger says he felt entitled....what about all the people who feel entitled to his private life because he is more talented than they are. That should not be tolerated and in my opinion, its interesting. Its his personal life. Stay out of it world. After all he has done to lift himself up and in doing so lift so many others up at the same time, what support do they show now. Unbelievable, Grrrrr, makes my blood boil. Im pulling for Tiger to sort it all out.<br><br>24th February 2010 : On second thoughts, does anyone really care or not think that its a personal issue. Why did he have a press conference about it, and make an issue of it by going head to head with the matchplay competition, that was silly, he should just keep quiet about it, refer to it as a personal issue and get back to playing golf, which after all is just hitting a ball around a field with a stick. I think its really built up in his head and there's probably no mob out there that wants to get him. Its gotta be tough, i mean, he did just lose his partner.</p>

<p>February 24, 2010 : All you can eat mussels at Bistro Campagne, viva les moules !</p>

<p>March 20, 2010 : I was totally rooting for England, even after we lost to Scotland, though in essence it was to make the triumph all the greater for France in the end by having them do it all on their own, so in a way it was rooting for France. Its not logical but its true. Lousy game all the same though I liked how England played. The Ireland Scotland game was much better, thought it was going to be in Murrayfield but got to see another game at Croker, bonus. I really liked seeing the games at Croke Park, for me it gave a strong feeling of all being together. Not that that will diminish going forward. A very successful campaign.</p>

<p>March 3, 2010 : Cadburys Creme Eggs, hurrayyyyy, the most delicous creation of all time, on shelves now, cant eat too many though, well can try not to ! I just ate four.</p>

<p>April 2, 2010 : Listening to the reworked version of living color's cult of personality ( <a href="#" onClick="javascript:openNewBrowser('http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzdUy90vTuk');return false;"> click </a>&nbsp;) and thinking about the concert last september. It was a small club and i went up to the band afterwards and eventually said to Vernon Ried something along the lines of 'Dude, HOLY SHIT !'. What I wish i had of said at the time was that i have heard for years about how Hendrix and Johnson had a quality to their guitar playing that was beyond ordinary, beyond extraordinary, but that id never personally come even close to an understanding of what that meant until i heard him play that night.</p>

<p>April 2010 : Havent seen the new doctor yet but have been glancing at reports and comments, hmmmmm, probably best that i dont see him for a while anyway, still getting over david tennant you see.</p>

<p>April 2010 : Dude...Turbo Fruits. (&nbsp;<a href="#" onClick="javascript:openNewBrowser('http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZGGAZNB6HM');return false;">clickity click</a>&nbsp;)</p>

<p>April 2010 : Spent the evening in the company of Henry the Troublemaker last night at the vic. He ended his epic trip by wrapping his arm around Phil Lynotts shoulder, i like to think he was giving a wink to  <a href="#" onClick="javascript:openNewBrowser('http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDM469h7880');return false;">a fellow rocker</a>. Disconnected ? Anything But. <a href="#" onClick="javascript:openNewBrowser('http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAXL4R_keTY&NR=1');return false;">CONNECT YOURSELF AND OWN THIS CENTURY</a></p>

<p>April 2010 : Developing a website on Godaddy, it is driving me insane, Godaddy are definitely in league with the devil if not actually the devil himself !</p>

<p>April 2010 : Ladies and Gentlemen, we are floating in space. ( Scroll to Letters ) <a href="#" onClick="javascript:openNewBrowser('http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2010/apr/27/the-fiver-west-ham-champions-league');return false;">Click It Up Now !</a> . Its a little bittersweet as it is the national keeper...Still the oxygen was a bit much Shay.</p>

<p>April 2010 : Steve Davis - What a Man. The last time i proclaimed that was watching Jeff Bridges at the Oscars. Life is full of wonderful surprises, Steve 'Interesting' Davis on par, perhaps even cooler, than the Dude. A loveable dufus managing to amble through the chaos of existance versus the will and vulnerability of the indefatigable warriors inevitable defeat someday. Steve 'Interesting' Davis, Riviting. His favorite biscuit is the Garibaldi, perhaps. </p>

<p>May 2010 : Danny Noonan at Quail Hollow, Nice ! </p>

<p>May 2010 : Champions League, Heineken Cup, Stanley Cup, its all go in the sit down world of the spectator ! Congratulations Toulouse, good defense on both sides, made for lots of kicking and only one set down from a breakaway, some very nearlys but poor passing mistakes, though you know i dont care, im glad Toulose won.  </p>

<p>May 2010 : Lost. Liked the ending. Probably disagree with it philosophically, lifes rewards should not come in the after life - Life is the reward, but in the case of the guys on lost it made me feel happy that at least they all ended up together and with each other. People should get together. On the subject of Life being the reward, Lost started about the same time I moved back to Chicago from California, and as windy turn around batshit crazy as the plot of Lost was, they may have got more done in their lives than I have in mine. Im a bit closer to my family now, particularly with Carole and Stephen ; friends, ive lost a few and kept a few, really would like a few more ; two good relationships with girls I liked but didnt really want to spend my life with in the end and one failed effort with one I really did. Oh dear. The Lost plot is begining to look a bit tame. I did get to shake hands with the Beastie Boys robot at the Gala Event though, that was pretty awesome. Parp Parp ! Onwards !<p>

<p>June 2010 : Rafa is gone, they better not put Jurgen Klinsman in ! Watching the Stanley Cup finals, very good, compelling hockey, havent enjoyed it as much in a long time. Got my motorbike out of storage towards the end of last month and dropped the needles to lean out the mid to higher RPMs, picked up a speeding ticket within 24 hours, now thats Nascar.</p>
<p>June 2010 : The IPad, Its a massive IPhone.</p>
<p>June 2010 : Just got a shout out on Metal Notes about having appeared on Jo Maxi. The legend lives on. ( Well, I guess it wasnt really a shout out as I did write in and tell them and they just read the email as they had been talking about Jo Maxi earlier. Still...Nice! )</p>
<p>June 2010 : Chicago Wins ! </p>
<p>June 2010 : The World Cup is a GO ! <a href="#" onClick="javascript:openNewBrowser('http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HjK6Uh_5e0');return false;">Magic Video !</a></p>
<p>June 2010 : Not present at the  opening ceremonies but i did get to be there vicariously through the guardians MBM report !! ! <a href="#" onClick="javascript:openNewBrowser('http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2010/jun/11/world-cup-2010-south-africa-mexico-live');return false;"> Opening Game </a></p>
<p>June 2010 : USA! vs England - There they stood, eying each other across two hundred years of battlefields, arm in arm for many, pitted against for the rest; England, the redcoats, resplendent in white, the Americans wearing revolutionary blue. The names of their generals were well known to the americans, Gerrard, Lampard, Terry. These were men whose heroic virtues were already assured in the competetive forges of the European leagues, hungry now to play out their stories on the National stage only the World cup affords. And how it started, with a goal from their Captain, the ball gliding effortlessly through the american defenses and guided into the american net. It looked lost from the outset. Again and Again, the american lines buckled and organization fell into disarray as the English advanced. Parries were made into English territory and chances appeared only to fall by the wayside. Until Clint Dempsey, with surely little hope of success, lifted his head outside the area, he had to know his chances were next to nothing but he hit at the ball, hit it with all his heart. The ball didnt fly but stumbled, it came clumsily off his foot and hobbled along the earth but it was headed in the right direction, towards its goal. He must have thought to himself how little chance the ball had, but how he wanted it to go in. And into the net it went, through the hands of the keeper. A shot taken with heart finds its goal. There are times when nothing can stop such a shot, for me I already know it to be the Goal of the Tournament. Did you see it,  Did you hear it, the shot heard round the world, echoing down across the years, in South Africa, on Saturday 12 June, 2010.</p>
<p>June 2010 : Oo-ahhh - Cotes D'Ivoire, I said Oh-ahhh Cotes D'Ivoire. Im supporting Ivory Coast this world Cup, largely on the basis of their flag being like the Irish Flag, a desire to see an African Team do well, and the chant at the begining of this sentence being very catchy. I dont know their history too well, I hope im not getting behind some horrible dictatorship born out of French colonial cruelty. I should probably look into that, maybe by supporting them through the cup, I'll learn a little more about them. Hey Now, Drogba's just come on, to quote the MBM, this could be very interesting.</p>
<p>June 2010 : you can disagree with your neighbour, you can dislike your neighbour, you can wish the very worst for them, but you cant have your shared government open fire on them. sounds fair to me. We can never forget the past but we must move on. I dont think its simply the soldiers or the victims, its all of us. Impressive that this report was taken, maybe just that it seems to have gone the victims way, but most places cover this stuff up, to uncover a truth no matter how ugly. There may not have been any poetry in how England played on Saturday but its certainly hung in there for its subjects and its state on this occasion. More prose than poetry. Surely, its a stronger and more sustainable state that is able to meet events openly and clear eyed and also recognise when its not. also, its not like this was the only Bloody Sunday, what the black and tans did to the civilian population is far worse, if you can even rate events like these one above the other.</p>
<p>June 2010 : Wahaayyyyy ! Its Istanbul for USA ! Great comeback, watching in office drooling over thinking about watching it live, why oh why didnt I call in...im holding out for a round 2 game !!! thats why !!! Im very dissapointed in France , totally wrecked, that they didnt give it all to win after the manner in which they qualified. If you are going to steal it, you better fucking want it. I can understand that they may not want the team to be succesful after the qualification but its pretty disrespectful to Ireland to not even care about being in the world cup after that. Quelle Horror !! I dont know why it is that Irish boys are hardwired to fall for French girls.</p>
<p>June 2010 : CMon Paul Casey</strong></p>
<p>June 2010 : Graeme MacDowell, Steady as she goes as the Raconteurs say !!</p>
<p>June 2010 : Ivory Coast are out !! Poor Ivory Coast, they were Sven Goran Erickssoned. He really did one on them. How about Landon Donavan though, Very Nice !</p>
<p>July 2010 : World Cup Final : Decent game, though most of the tension for me arose from seeing if the Octopus was going to be right. </a></p>
<p>July 2010 : One World Cup Ends - Another Begins ! <a href="#" onClick="javascript:openNewBrowser('http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVR0ZsYTFwI');return false;"> Four Years To Go</a>&nbsp;CMON IRELAND !! </p>
<p>July 2010 : Oh Dear, Im very depressed now that theres no more world cup finals, and, if thats not bad enough on its own, Lance has hit the deck on the Tour. </p>
<p>July 2010 : I didnt see the Meath goal in the Meath / Louth game over the weekend but Meaths refusal to give Louth a rematch sounds pretty much the same as the world cup qualifier incident. The exact same thing in fact. So there. The Irish are just like the French, so climb down off those high horses and get on with qualifying for the next world cup.</p>
<p>July 2010 : Just Heard about Carole Vorderman. How could they. How dare they. They wont see it coming but they will have full awareness when it does.</p>
<p>July 2010 : Transformers 3 is filming in Chicago, its fun to check out the movie set, it all looks so simple and paired down before the effects get drawn in. The explosions are underwhelming, just some propane lines and firecrackers It does look like a lot of fun to do though, running around the place and im sure theres loads of industry tricks that underwrite the finished product. Transformers are pretty cool, theres no robots but the cars are around. In Disguise.</p>
<p>July 2010 : Current Music Trends - Everyone is putting electronic beeps into their songs at the begining, like aural amuse bouches, clearing and focusing the pallete for the melody meat to come. Im refering to Mgmt, Phoenix, Broken Bells. Its quite good, I like to listen to them as im falling asleep.</p>
<p>August 2010 : Rovers Forever. Forever Rovers. CMon the Rovers !</p>
<p>October 2010 : UN-BE-LIEV-ABLE : What do these guys want ! They bought an asset which they managed and it declined in value. The revenue stream the team makes is now lower than when they bought, theres no additional income from top flight european competetion and they didnt build a higher capacity stadium that genereates match day income and specail events income. The club is not worth as much !! They did not invest and the future revenue valuations are lower ergo it has a lower valuation. It will be interesting to see what these offers appear to be , sound ENRONesque. Its not national as the new owners are going to be from the same country, why they didnt go with Kenny Huang though is a mystery. Red shirts and China's burgeoning middle class, thats some revenue. And hes called Kenny !!. Maybe the Chinese state wanted all of it and didnt want to share with Pool. Football, its never Rational...Thats why its so great. All in all though, in the immortal words of Father Ted - Down with this kind of Thing, Booooo, Down with this kind of Thing. Careful Now.</p>
<p><a href="#" onClick="javascript:openNewBrowser('http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_9135000/9135454.stm');return false;"> Its still going on... </a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>November 2010 :Brain Dump on the Banks in Ireland<br>Theres a knock at the door :
Theres a passage in a book called 3 Days in September - when the Pope came to Ireland, Liberties Press, where a narrator at the phoenix park comments about seeing a man driving alongside a line of portaloos in a mercedes while a young fella was running into each loo, whipping out the loo paper and depositing the rolls onto the back seat. Very entrepreneurial the narrator commented, and was sure enough that they excelled in the environment of the Celtic Tiger Economy. That was back then, in the golden age of the church in Ireland. Modern times it appears the same business model has been employed, with Ango Irish bank as the portaloo, Brian cowen the driver of the Mercedes and Sean Fitzpatrick perhaps the young whipper snapper plunging into the portaloos to find the treasure. I suppose Brian Cowen and Sean Fitzpatrick are interchangable depending on who you want to put portapotty diving at any given time.

Thats a comical passage, in truth, theres a lot of ugliness exposed by a moving economy, most notably for me when i lived there were the young and healthy ( temporarily ) people you could see living on the streets in the late nineties and early two thousands highlighting a shocking neglect shown to people in Ireland, what of their sovereignty, the people are the sovereignty of the country. It was shocking back then, people stepped over and continued on. For many it seems that progress is only possible if there is suffering and pain involved, generally, no, always someone else's, its pre-requisite. Its crazy. Progress and prosperity should be as easy as drinking water and any true prosperity lifts all boats rather than dashes some onto the rocks of despair. The latter is Poverty. A couple of grumbles back then but theres no uproar until the international financial markets and their corrupt brethern in the ratings agencies say its time to reconcile your sovereignty. Fuck Off to them. Its absurd but in a more positive light its also illuminating. Also, the people are the Soveigrnty of Ireland, and i dont see them handing it over. I know Im not.

It would be nice to see the behaviour thats led to the present circumstance understood in a mainstream fashion and going forward to try and improve our understanding of economic development and wealth generation. Particularly with respects to sustainability. Also, Id like to see a stronger single currency mechanism which is not vulnerable to the visciditutes of a handful of ambitious bankers operating in the private economy. What kind of a shambolic currency gets knocked down by that. you never get understanding other than the understanding you take, you are never going to be told whats going on.

Also, how is financing the national debt a threat to sovereignty, its absurd. If you stop paying your mortgage, do you stop being you, do you lose your identity. A Country is a great deal more than its banking transactions. Though, sure, sure, currency represents an amalgamation of values and beliefs, perhaps going as far as representing a qualitative attempt at describing its epistemeology. Paul Krugman noted that countries are not like corporations. Ireland has an awful lot going for it that people are very willing to look over.

Its an ill wind, and it surely brought good as well. Also, Structural reform of the Euro is required, should it survive.
</p>

<p> The Banks are a bit like the line in the John Donne Poem, A Hymn to God the Father, "When you have done, you have not done, for I have More". Perhaps the maligned but sovereign Irish Citizen might write their a letter to the minister begining...Oh Batter My Heart ECB, IMF, Money Markets Gods. I prefer a little Dylan Thomas myself, And The ECB shall have no dominion, though its hyperbole, bluster, sound, fury. The ECB manages the Euro, of course it has dominion. Thats its Job. I hope we acted and reigned in the debt in time last year. I think we did, we have been ahead of this problem and are making the right decisions, the bankers may still dissapoint though. And the Irish are very fiscally conservative, It would be irresponsible to not take action to strenghen the currency in light of the countrys inability to devalue its currency ( ooops, is the soverignty that people are talking about already gone since 1992 / 1999 )</p>

<p>Is this a bailout for the Euro or a bailout for Ireland. The Irish are choosing to strengthen the Euro rather than get huffy about what the Media and Markets are blowing up into a Sovereignty issue. I understand banks have run up quite the bar tab during the free credit period and that it is appaling but the Irish are choosing to protect the Euro. We have a strong economy and a very wonderful country and we are not looking to hijack anybody, just increase the prosperity of our Island and improve the living conditions upon it and not do harm to others living in other countries. Oh great, now Stevie Gerard has hammy knack, thats perfect.</p>

<p>April 2011 : Oh Dear. How Many More Times. For the Love of Christ...anyway, Leinster for the Heineken Cup, heres to the blackhawks digging out, heres to the Dublin Hurlers, Heres to Rory, All in all I was more surprised that Woods missed those puts than anything else.</p>

<p>April 2011 : I read an article in the tribune today about how the creator of the voyager spacecraft was excited about some curious data they had just received back from the outer edges of the solar system. Edward Carroll Stone was born in Iowa in 1936, when putting a man on the moon was the stuff of fiction and text books speculated about a jungle covered Mars.</p>

I guess, given the context, to reduce corruption, it seems ok, but its still a bit creepy. Kind of Ari Fleischer like. Overall on Blago, it seems like a mash up between hustling and overextending, hustling is one thing, shaking down a childrens hospital is another.</p>

Fast Eddie: once at Ames with Minnesota Fats and then again at Arthur's, in that cheap, crummy pool room, now why'd I do it, Sarah? Why'd I do it? I coulda beat that guy, coulda beat 'im cold, he never woulda known. But I just hadda show 'im. Just hadda show those creeps and those punks what the game is like when it's great, when it's REALLY great. You know, like anything can be great, anything can be great. I don't care, BRICKLAYING can be great, if a guy knows. If he knows what he's doing and why and if he can make it come off. When I'm goin', I mean, when I'm REALLY goin' I feel like a... like a jockey must feel. He's sittin' on his horse, he's got all that speed and that power underneath him... he's comin' into the stretch, the pressure's on 'im, and he KNOWS... just feels... when to let it go and how much. Cause he's got everything workin' for 'im: timing, touch. It's a great feeling, boy, it's a real great feeling when you're right and you KNOW you're right. It's like all of a sudden I got oil in my arm. The pool cue's part of me. You know, it's uh - pool cue, it's got nerves in it. It's a piece of wood, it's got nerves in it. Feel the roll of those balls, you don't have to look, you just KNOW. You make shots that nobody's ever made before. I can play that game the way... NOBODY'S ever played it before.

<!-- Fast Eddie: You know, I got a hunch, fat man. I got a hunch it's me from here on in. One ball, corner pocket. I mean, that ever happen to you? You know, all of a sudden you feel like you can't miss? 'Cause I dreamed about this game, fat man. I dreamed about this game every night on the road. Five ball. You know, this is my table, man. I own it.
<br>---------------------<br>
Fast Eddie: How should I play that one, Bert? Play it safe? That's the way you always told me to play it: safe... play the percentage. Well, here we go: fast and loose. One ball, corner pocket. Yeah, percentage players die broke, too, don't they, Bert?

Cashier: No bar, no pinball machines, no bowling alleys, just pool... nothing else. This is Ames, mister.
