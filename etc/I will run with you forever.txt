I will run with you forever

though im not running by your side, i still run with you,
i feel you in my soul, i feel you in my heart, my head, i love you.
its killing me, my chest has no air, my heart is hanging like an old door, blown off its mountings,
its bursting out of me, and at the same time i cant breathe, i need you to take breath for me,
if your heart smiles, your head frees, and your soul rings, then my lungs will fill with air, and i will be well again.
ill be better than well, love having being sent out from my shores, and being returned again upon my shores, will escalate and grow,
each replenishing and filling the other, and we will sail on the waves of life and I love you, I love you, I love you.
