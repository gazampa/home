<P>Well I never...look who it is...bestowing his Shatner magic onto the VIC 20.
The name Commodore, I have heard, is still in use today by a Dutch computer-chain store. I had one

Booooooo for parents. If you're a kid out there reading this remember to watch more TV and never listen to your parents.
I played with it a lot but after I discovered girls, not so much :?)
