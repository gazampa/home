Four Men in a Bar. no vocal communication. All communication is through a screen visible to the Audience. the communication is shared between the four but comes out on the screen as texts. Shared Internal monolouge.

1: Good Grief.
3: I know.
1: I mean...
3: I know.
1: Could it have been ?
3: always, but, thats not helpful now
4: Ta Panta Rhei.
3: omnia dicta fortiora si dicta Latina
4: it was Greek
3: ah, you know what i mean.
2: Ha Ha...gobshites
3: thats all you ever say
2: I know, and am I ever wrong, 
3: Well, According to yourself...
2: yeah, well...



1 = some wounded id. bankrupt, never, turns out to be strong. why the ego supplicates to it.
2 = a driving aggressive ego, unblemished, perhaps in a flawed way, perhaps it should be, no, it sees flaws and admits them and finds way to overcome them, it will not stop. Supplicant to the id, at times - suggesting a lack of confidence, doesnt really listen anyway
3 = reason, as close to it as the writer can manage, or as close as the character will accept.
4 = sentiment, heart, maybe change this as its not very masculine, its kind of hanging around with nowhere to go. stuck in its place, nothing can move it as its hardwired to be what it is. everything else can be negotiated, or cajoled, 4 cannot, it just is as it is. and it comes across as slightly boring. it made its mind up a long time ago.

together they form one internal dialouge 

----- This bit is way too busy -------- maybe save for later
2: Ahhh, No, According to everyone, at least anyone that counts. Its all about the timing you see, and its timing that keeps the world in motion. Sure everything changes but when its changing, therein lies the mercury, the quicksilver. its the most useful phrase in the English Language. multi faceted as a diamond and can be used in almost any situation, its all a matter of timing, of when you drop it.
4: Fuck Off, seriously, surely its the condition, what it was and what it is, what its going to be, what it could be.
2: Seriously, just look at yourself, you never change, miserable. Just so you can feel right. Or that you are in control.
4: what the fuck would you know, goin around with like a sociopath, have you ever had an emotion you recognised.
2: I get things done.
4: And we dont...what fuckin things are they anyway. And what or who is it makes you do them.
2: you wouldnt all be sittin here being miserable if it wasnt for the likes of me pal, misery is the morphine of the western world, all the top spots are really miserable, believe me, and you have no idea what misery is until it hits you, these cunts are miserable. No joy. you fuckin sacks of shit. most of em inherited it at this stage, they think that the misery gives them an aura of having made it themselves, like they know the pain, they probably fake it too, the only thing they really want is to persist. And those kids in the back of beyond, they dont have time to be miserable, theyre starvin
4: And it was Bob Geldof, the most miserable git of all that did anything about it, so stop pourin credit on yourself you dont neccesarily deserve. you might do some stuff but you dont do all of it, thats your fucking problem.
2: Fat lot of good that did, wouldnt you say, are they really any better off. And more to the point, what have those fuckers done for us lately.
4: Yeah I would, If only that a lot more people know about it and that some people had the Grace to even think they could help out, yeah.
2: Now thats a lot of Crap. A really big pile of it, right there. Knowledge its nothing without action and not just action, the right action, and again...at the right time, and thats me pal, Sociopath, Im a fucking executioner.
3: Cool it, fuck sake, Cool the beans right there.
4: Cool It, Im gonna fuckin burn it.
3: well, just sit there and enjoy that pint first, then go burn it, whatever it is this time round.
4: Already burned in my mind, I will sit here, and I will enjoy my pint, I fucking love my pint.
3: And no one around here is fawning over what youve done, we know who you are, remember, not just what you do.
4: You say that like its a bad thing, you fucking slaves, miserable penitents, fuckin right, Gobshites, the lot of ye. And as for that fucker, jaysus H, fuck sake, can you fucking Believe it, Yeah, I can, ok. you dont think I know, I know.
2: Alright, you've said your bit, full of vim and vigour, we all like that, its the easy flowing rivers that carve the deepest canyons.
4: Yeah, Right, Fuck, I always hear that but you know never see it. What is there to see, its invisible.
2: Thats the idea, so fuckers like you dont fuck it up. Watch Out Kid, They keep it all Hid.
4: There was never anything there in the first place, if there was something there, it would be there. If there wasnt, then there nothing. What is there.
Silence
4: Quid pro Quo, Gobshites, Fuckers, HahaHa.....and fuck your canyons, whats so great about them, donkey rides, thats all they're good for.
2: The voracity of your belief does not neccesarily make it true. me thinks the lady dost protest too much.
