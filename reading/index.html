<h3>The Sentinel (Chicago)</h3>

<p>The Sentinel stands alone, alert,<br>
Beside the rag and bone shop,<br>
Its collar drawn close, eyes narrowed, <br>
Shrouded in anonymity, the passers-by pass by.</p>

<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br><br><br>



<h3>UNDERNEATH THE BANYAN TREE</h3>

<p>Underneath the Banyan Tree I lay,<br>
For a while, cool and protected in the shade,<br>
Outside the rim the sun burned and baked,<br>
Splintering the hard cracked earth,<br>
I, closed my eyes and dreamed.</p>

<p>The wind gently hushed the leaves,<br>
The scent and spray of the ocean<br>
Curling through their tips and veins,<br>
Wrapping their limbs in natures embrace<br>
Gathering strength the winds whisper softly stole my shelter.</p>

<p>Stirring my sleep, uprooting my dreams<br>
Taking my peace not telling me where<br>
Till I was left aware I was alone<br>
Not knowing how I had reached this place<br>
With indistinct memory of something lost</p>

<p>Without picture, only touch, of what I have not words,<br>
Heavily I rose, squinting, pulling my collar round,<br>
The wind bustling my way through streets indifferently familiar,<br>
I found my way to a tavern,<br>
And drank till I could hear no more.</p>

<p>I lie with you now and we dream<br>
Rooted together in satisfied slumber,<br>
Sleepily whispering of victories taken,<br>
Limbs wrapped, glistening and aching in still light,<br>
Desire drugged awhile by dreams delirium.</p>

<p>Yet at times I awake,<br>
Listening carefully for the wind.</p>

<br>

<h3>I Am With You As The Wind.</h3>

<p>I am with you as the Wind, my love<br>
I am with you as the Wind.</p>

<p>You worked by my side in the orchard that day,<br>
Never lifting your head from the earth,<br>
My soul ringing with pride,<br>
As we gracefully massaged life from its soil,</p>

<p>The meadow was mature and sweet when we rested,<br>
Stealing a moment from the midday sun,<br>
The sound of rustling like children whispering,<br>
Soothing away the creases of the mornings work,</p>

<p>Laying in the grass together, I rested my head in your lap,<br>
Your hand caressing my brow, leveling the mountains of mind,<br>
Your voice tells me now you are happy,<br>
As you softly hum your song.</p>

<p>And it was he who tricked me and took my hand my love<br>
Rising, brushing off the dust I turned<br>
And saw you still brushing my sleeping brow,<br>
Smiling, humming, thinking of the evening meal.</p>

<p>I tore at those eyes and gnawed at that face but nothing stopped its purpose,<br>
So this is how I left my love, this is how I died.<br>
I kissed your lips my love you felt it as the wind.</p>

<p>I am with you as the Wind, my love<br>
I am with you as the Wind.</p>

<h3>The Sun is Burning. ( My Love Eternal )</h3>

<p>Inside of me it roars, turning and turning and turning again,<br>
Driving, Driving, Driving,<br>
Galloping with herds for miles, Forward Ever Forward,<br>
This eternal purpose propelling me further,<br>
I hear it all and see it now, this instant, this evermore.<br>
Screaming with joy, what wonderful abandon,<br>
Whipping the eyes of the winds, lifting upwards, and drenching the rain.<br>
And I have only this skin to protect me,<br>
To draw around this gossamer soul.</p>
<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br><br><br>

<h3>Mostly Painful</h3>
<p>I burn for you, I burn for you now,<br>
can endure any pain, dissolve any sorrow<br>
by the pursuit of the goal, the divination of the heart.<br>
i hear your thoughts, am in your mind, am part of you<br>
want to run, just run, until all we have is the running,<br>
because in the end all we ever have is the running, of life, blood, love<br>
on your knees boy, here stands a goddess.<br>
on your feet girl, he runs for you now. <br><br>

revel, these days will never end.</p>
<br>

<h3>The Meaning Of Life</h3>
<p>exploding atoms and blazing molecules,<br>
beating hearts, constricted chests, bursting for air<br>
I will whip this into a frenzy and lie back as its rapture flows through me<br>
then you will know what you ask, and your head will fall back, and cry with joy<br>
for none other shall ever come this way again, for all the questions are answered<br>
and now i live, and now i laugh, and now i love, for evermore.<br></p>

<h3>forever falling</h3>

<p>I run by your side, I will run with you, forever<br>
i feel you in my bones, my heart, my mind, i love you.<br>
its killing me, my chest has no air, my heart is banging like an old door, blown off its mountings,<br>
its bursting out of me, and at the same time i cannot breathe, need you to take breath for me,<br>
if your heart is open, and your soul rings too, my lungs will fill with air, and i will be well again.<br>
ill be better, love being sent out from my shores, and being returned again, will escalate and grow,<br>
each replenishing and filling the other, and we will sail through the waves, and I love you, I love you, I love you.<br>
and now i fall, i fall, i fall.</p>

<h3>London ( is burning )</h3>

<p>Your buildings are burning, love, stone,<br>
Turning to sand.<p>

<p>Blackened eyes, rib cage bared, <br>
Husk exposed to the wind.</p>

<p>They envy you your place,<br>
Set amongst the gentle veins</p>

<p>You rise, You rise.<br>
This is your Glory.</p>

<p>Your people are burning,<br>
Their souls lit with henious passion,<br>
For themselves, for each other, for life<br>
They stand against themselves and against the rest of the world<br>
As it falls and weeps, its own wretched image reflected in the river</p>


<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br><br><br>
<h3>Where Shall We Smoke ?</h3>
<p>Where shall you go now, to smoke your cigarettes,<br>
No longer can you sit and draw upon them here,<br>
I hope you liked that world, so clean,<br>
With pills for every trouble, and no cigarettes.</p>

<p>The sights that were seen in the smoke, what truth,<br>
All washed away now, by the scribbling pen,<br>
And who gave you that pen, was it me,<br>
It used to but is no more.</p>

<p>The ember placed upon a leaf,<br>
Its fire burning glow racing out,<br>
Forward, grinding, driving,<br>
Why did they take it, where is it now.</p>

<p>And all the cities fell away, like ash, one after the other<br> 
Acquiescence, an example to all,<br>
They passed so pleasingly,<br>
So proud.</p>

<p>Eureka, I have found it.</p>


<br>

<h3>The Idiot Circus ( Globalizzation )</h3>
<p>The sun rises again, incredibly, over the hallowed countryside,<br>
Untilled fields lazy, telling stories no more,<br>
Rows barren now as the city streets,<br>
Where have all the people gone,<br>
Gone to the Idiot Circus, one and all.<br>
Roll Up Roll Up, there's a place for everyone,<br>
Performers, Dazzlers, Exotica and freaks,<br>
And seats for everyone, not one left out.<br>
The sweeper now performs the trapeze act,<br>
The artist, only careful to take the bow,<br>
Everyone applauds the spectacle why, its never been so good,<br>
The sweeper returns to his broom, why<br>
The rats chase the snakes and the rats chase the snakes.</p>

<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br><br><br>

<h3>Take My Chances With You</h3>
<p>I've taken my chances with you before,<br>
Winning the game only to lose the board,<br>
Smiling and gay, I return the same,<br>
Do you want to play ? No, do you ?</p>


<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br><br><br>

<h3>New Republican Dream</h3>
<p>Come with me now my blue eyed girl,<br>
Let us slip the surly bonds of this day,<br>
Lets escape away and meet the eternals, our only keepers,<br>
And find a place where we can fuck till we are raw, then diminish<br>
There in the lingering light of day,<br>
We will drink from each others well,<br>
You from mine and I from yours,<br>
We will drink till satiated and no more.<br>
Oh, the sights we will see.</p>

<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br><br><br>

<h3>Original Sin And The Protestant Reformation</h3>
<p>Fuck Off, - No, You Fuck Off</p>

<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br><br><br>


<h3>The Evaluation</h3>
<p>Its my turn now to say, to say those things,<br>
To revel in the telling,<br>
Oh petty, terrible, untruthful lies,<br>
Its my turn, Mine.<br>
Yours. Someday? it will be mine, what will I say ?</p>

<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br><br><br>

<h3>WTF</h3>
<p>this lost momment, this connection lost,<br>
a consumation devoutly to be wished.<br>
pure voice held within its tones the whisper of some desire<br>
and on mine the poorest and only response I could return.<br>
but connections are lost, no fault of our own<br>
we are living and knowing all our lives, but in truth,<br>
a consumation devoutly to be missed</p>

<br>

<h3>The Lady Of The Rocks ( Prufrock - Be Damned )</h3>

The lady of the rocks,<br>
Upon whose shores my heart resides,<br>
From where does this pain come,<br>
Maybe I would know a cure.<br>
Before it was pointed to be sure,<br>
Only now knowing it is never to be returned<br>
Pours tears upon rock.<br>
A clump of old clothes has more life to it now,<br>
What life there is, swallowed in the deadpools,<br>
From whence only the old return.<br>
I cannot, will not be bound by this bullshit !!<br>
Lady of situations my arse,<br>
The one eyed merchant will find his slimy urchin, and rudley forced too.<br>
Under rocks and in nasty crevices, and the only riches you find, for it was you denied our love,<br>
Are the cackles of the overthrown, who can only despair in the numbness of their lives.<br>

<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br><br><br>

<h3>Footfalls</h3>
<p>footfall after weary footfall, oh christ, Zombie Town<br>
haha, its great to be here, really,<br>
i could have been out there contending,<br>
lord i miss its pain, its constant pain,<br>
and the rewards, trifles as they are<br>
compared to the taunts and smiles of one who understands<br>
who understands that the footfalls will never stop<br>
that they will never cease, as they are all steps<br>
that lead to her, to her door, and into her arms<br>
to sleep, forever to sleep in exhausted coitus.</p>

<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br><br><br>

<h3>my gypsy love</h3>
<p>we will lie now, never to see each other again,<br>
it's the only way we can protect ourselves,<br>
what we have, what we feel, who we are, who we've always and will forever be.<br>
this world is cruel and dreadful, can only castigate and debase,<br>
we wander, we move, mimick defeat, to stay alive, to keep alive,<br>
we are the powerless,<br> 
but to have been with you, to have known this joy,<br>
i can suffer indignity at any time and never feel it, can court it as a test,<br>
let us love now, let us live, let us live for every other momment that we will die,<br>
for every member of our tribe, we will cry and our voices will carry<br>
carry forever on the wind, carry through the air and they will know,<br>
that they can never touch us, that they can never understand us,<br> 
that they will only ever hate us.<br>
I will sing of you and when I dance it will be of you that I am dreaming,<br>
my darling gypsy love, my dance will be strong and my voice hard, i will shout down this<br>
terrible, dreadful world.<br>
truly yours.<br>
</p>

<h3>The Unaffected.</h3>
<p>Nothing has changed,<br>
Nothings going on, Huh, <br>
Nor would it, How could it.<br>
No, America is unaffected.<br>
America sleeps, a dreamless, restless sleep.<br>
it wakes, it shrugs, goes about its business,<br>
shuffles through the papers, cuts and thrusts,at empty air,<br>
there could be something very wrong, it knows, but<br>
its seen it before,its unaffected, utterly unaffected<br>
and protected.<br>

<h3>Can Any Body Find Their Way Home</h3>
<p>the sun rises serenely, over a blinding horizon, the earth turns,<br>
the mechanics of the heavens glide effortlessly on, unjolted, it doesn't matter, it means nothing.<br>
and it meant everything, a glance, a smile, a peel of laughter,<br>
a lifetime lived and ended on a moment, intent ? misunderstanding ? a mistake ?<br>
unexpected relief, a release, from the cruelty of its grip.<br>
Motherfucker, how can it be so, it shouldn't, how could it be any other, how can it be left,<br>
how can the tides be turned, Ill go and command them.<br>
but how the waters engulfed me, and swallowed me whole,<br>
turned to brittle deadwood, tinder for another fire,<br>
a man dies and the earth turns easily for there are other men,<br>
can anyone here find their way home.<br>
<!-- plenty can and plenty do, and so the world keeps turning.<br>
burn it up people. -->
